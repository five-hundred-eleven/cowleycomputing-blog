See: <https://github.com/five-hundred-eleven/goland-game>

This is a toy project to improve my skills in Go and graphical programming.

I use [github.com/veandco/go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) for the raw GUI. Everything else down to the raytracers and shaders are my own design.

In the current iteration, everything is done in CPU. Due to the simple nature of this project it still achieves a high framerate. In the future I hope to do another iteration that brings in OpenGL.
