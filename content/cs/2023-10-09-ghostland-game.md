See [ghostland-game](https://github.com/five-hundred-eleven/ghostland-game) on github.

This is a continuation of my [goland-game](https://github.com/five-hundred-eleven/goland-game) project.

While the previous project was implemented in go, for this project I was not able to get the go bindings for OpenGL working, and so I went with C++.
