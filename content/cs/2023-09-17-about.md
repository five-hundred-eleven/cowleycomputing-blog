My name is Erik Cowley. This site is my portfolio for personal programming projects.

I currently work as an engineer at ScienceLogic, where I develop software for monitoring networks.

The website name "stromsy" is derived from "Straumsey" (meaning "stormy seas"), which was an island encountered and named by Leif Erikson. It is mentioned in [The Saga of Erik the Red](https://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en).
