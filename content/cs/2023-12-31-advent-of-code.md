### Results

I earned 40 out of 50 possible stars, with no stars on days 22 and 25.

My highest ranking was for part 1 of [day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11). My ranking was 1315 and my time was 15:43. My part 1 solution was a direct brute force approach.

Another memorable problem was part 2 of [day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12), which was a fuzzy regex problem. My solution took me several days to work out. I used a memoized recursive-style (using an arg stack instead of actual recursion) approach.

### My Takeaways

* I learned about the [shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) for finding the area of a complex polygon.
* Importance of simplicity: For several problems, I tried to implement solutions that snowballed in complexity as I repeatedly added edge cases/optimizations. These types of solutions were **extremely** difficult to get to work. Putting in the extra planning for a clean, simple solution always paid off.
